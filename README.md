# modeling-social-networks
Polarization on social media has been gaining attention in recent times. This owes in part to the fact that social media has become a key resource in political influence. This project aims to model polarization while drawing upon theories in psychology and social sciences. Operationally, the project involves experimenting with the 'Polarizing Independent Cascade' model proposed by Prasetya & Murata, 2020.  
A simple version of the PIC model for exploration is made available [here](http://harshuedu.gitlab.io/polarization-social-networks/simulation-js/).
